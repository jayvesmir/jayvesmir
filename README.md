## About me

Hi! I'm a software developer from the Czech Republic. My codebases are always a mess (why most of my projects are private). I mainly use C++ and specialize in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Sometimes I play around with higher level languages as well.  
I'm a highschool freshman (15) so I'm very open to learning new stuff. I plan on studying Computer Science at NUS when I graduate HS.  

<b>I like the NieR franchise... a lot.</b>
