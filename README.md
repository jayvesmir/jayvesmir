## About me

Hi! I'm a software developer from the Czech Republic. My codebases are always a mess (why most of my projects are private). I mainly use C/C++ and specialize in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Sometimes I play around with higher level languages as well.<br>
I'm a highschool freshman (15) so I'm very open to learning new stuff. I plan on studying Computer Science at NUS when I graduate HS.  
I don't know why, but I can't really focus on one project for a prolonged period of time, so most of my projects progress very slowly lol

<b>I like the NieR franchise... a lot.</b>

## Public Projects
[TooB Lang](https://github.com/marceleenuh/2b-lang) - A very simple compiled programming language I'm working on for fun.<br>
[Tyrotical](https://github.com/marceleenuh/tyrotical) - My personal vulkan rendering engine.<br>

### Paused Projects
- [Ganyu](https://github.com/marceleenuh/ganyu-bot) - A genshin utility discord bot
  - Paused due to me not wanting to support discord anymore with their recent actions.
- [EAIO](https://github.com/marceleenuh/eaio) - Windows app aimed at AMV editors
  - Paused due to lack of new features to add and my terrible code style just being hard to update.
