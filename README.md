## About me

Hi! I'm a software developer from the Czech Republic. My codebases are always a mess (why most of my projects are private). <br>
I mainly use C/C++, but sometimes I play around with higher level languages as well.<br>
I'm a highschool freshman (16) so I'm very open to learning new stuff.  
I don't know why, but I can't really focus on one project for a prolonged period of time, so most of my projects progress very slowly lol

<b>I like the NieR franchise... a lot.</b>
